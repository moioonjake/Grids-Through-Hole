# Grids Through-Hole

Grids through-hole is a through-hole adaptation of the Mutable Instruments Grids Topographic drum sequencer. It’s a 100% non-commercial effort developed purely for own educational purposes where I’m trying to learn to understand schematics, Kicad and PCB making.

Please note that this is not yet tested or verified (2020-05), I’d like to hear your feedback if you built this unit so I can improve these files.

/ Design
from one PCB to two PCB.

/ Panel
original should work fine.
